Voog stands out from other website builders because of its commitment to simplifying multilingual websites and their focus on the developer community.

Multilingual Websites
Voog makes it easy to implement multilingual features on your website allowing you to publish your site in any language you like. Bridge the language barrier and reach people with your content that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. You can set preferred languages or have your website detect the user’s language based on their location.

Voog’s platform itself is available in 10 different languages making it user-friendly for a vast number of people.

Developer Tools
Developers will find everything they need to create their own custom websites with Voog. Instead of building websites on your own, Voog provides hosting, scaling, and security. The company gives you access to their HTML-based template code, CSS, and JavaScript.

This access makes the Voog website builder far more customizable than some other website builders on the market. With this access, you can extend the functionality of Voog’s platform.

Voog’s online code editor allows everything on the frontend of their websites to be completely editable. Their powerful API will give developers access to Voog’s software, allowing them to interface web apps and manage data or settings.

A developer toolkit provided by Voog lets developers continue work on the code editor they prefer. Their command line tool will keep your website synced with your code editor. Build store catalogs or dynamic portfolios with Voog’s database builder.

Additionally, Voog has a community of developer specialists where you can check out other individuals and companies using Voog to build websites for their customers.

Plans for Hobbyists and Enterprises
Voog offers plans for a range of users. The most expensive of these won’t be necessary for anyone below an enterprise-level business. This plan gives businesses unlimited resources, priority support, and a custom SSL certificate making it ideal for larger online stores that experience high traffic.

The lower-level plans are better suited to people with new websites or smaller online stores. With these, you’ll get:

E-commerce features
Shared SSL certificates
Password protected pages
Fully customizable designs
The difference between these lower-level plans varies according to e-commerce features and developer tools. For basic users, their cheapest plan should be all that you need.

For developers or more serious online stores, their mid-level plan should be perfect. This plan also comes with a free custom domain when you choose to bill annually. If you go with their cheaper plan, you can purchase a custom domain from Voog separately.

Included Hosting or Self-Hosting Options
You can either choose to host your Voog website on your own or take advantage of their free included hosting. When you choose to use Voog's hosting, you won't have to worry about updates, security, or scaling your performance when your site visitors spike. Voog will take care of all of this with their shared hosting.

Voog hosts your websites using Zone Media, an infrastructure provider in Estonia where their office is located.
